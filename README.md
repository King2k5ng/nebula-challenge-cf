# Nebula Techical Challenge Using AWS

In this challenge, i was required to create a website where a visitor can provide their name and the website responds with

 Hello (name that was provided) , your IP address is (IP address of visitor). 
 

## Proposed Solution
The diagram below shows an overveiw of how the solution functions.
![Proposed solution](https://github.com/King2k5ng/nebula-challenge-cf/blob/main/nebula_project.png)


In this solution, I create a webpage that is hosted on an S3 bucket and served using a CloudFront distribution. 
Resources are created using a cloudformation template. This solution take into consideration Cost Optimisation and Scalability 


### Solution Details

This solution creates an S3 bucket that hosts my static websiteâ€™s files(the files in the assets folder). 
The website is only accessible via CloudFront, not directly from S3.
The CloudFront Distrbution uses the S3 bucket's website endpoint as the origin, with anonymous (public) access allowed.
A cloudFormation template is used to create the resources needed for the solution

### Prerequisites
* AWS account
* AWS CLI
* linux system to run script to automate deployment of resources and uploading website assets to S3 bucket.
* Alternatively Windows user's can istall jq to run the script (setup.sh) using git bash.

### Deploying Solution
**Linux Users** can run this can run the Script "setup.sp" in the terminal, fill in some  parameters when promted, and the script would automate the deployment of your resources. The would also automate the loading of your objects (website assets folder) to the S3 bucket.

**Windows Users** can also repeat the steps above with the useing git bash after completeing the intallation of jq. Alternatively Windows users can also log into the AWS mangement console and upload the template to cloudformation to deloy the resources. However with this method you would also have to upload the webpage files to the S3 Bucket using the management console too.
